About

The Libft 42 Curses Project is an assignment that challenges you to create your own library of useful functions called libft and use it to build a simple game using the curses library. The project aims to enhance your understanding of data manipulation, memory allocation, and program flow control.
Installation

To use the Libft 42 Curses Project, follow the steps below:

    Clone the repository:

    shell

git clone https://github.com/your-username/libft-curses.git

Change into the project directory:

shell

cd libft-curses

Compile the library:

shell

    make

    Once the compilation is complete, you can start using the libft library and the game executable.

Usage

To use the libft library, include the appropriate header file in your code and compile it with the library.

c

#include "libft.h"

int main(void) {
    // Your code using libft functions
    return 0;
}

To compile your code with the libft library, use the following command:

shell

gcc -o your_program your_code.c -L. -lft

To run the game executable, simply execute the following command:

shell

./game

Documentation

The libft library provides various functions that can be used for common tasks such as string manipulation, memory management, list operations, and more. The documentation for each function is available in the corresponding header file (libft.h).

For detailed documentation and usage examples, refer to the Libft 42 Curses Project Wiki.
